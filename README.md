## About Me

Hi! My name is Valentina, and I'm a web developer with an eye for UI/UX design. Though I prefer working with the frontend, I am experienced in fullstack applications. I enjoy creating appealing, functional websites that are responsive and user friendly. Please feel free to reach out with project opportunities! I love sharing ideas and meeting new people.
