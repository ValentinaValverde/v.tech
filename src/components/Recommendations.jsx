            <p>
              I wholeheartedly recommend Valentina (Val) Valverde, an
              outstanding high school graduate who opted for a web development
              bootcamp over the traditional four-year college route. Val&apos;s
              journey has been remarkable, reflecting her tenacity, creativity,
              and dedication. Val&apos;s decision to bypass the traditional
              college path for a focused bootcamp speaks volumes about her
              determination to carve a unique niche in the tech industry. She is
              willing to take a big risk and is one of those few individuals who
              truly lives up to the idea of &quot;betting on yourself.&quot; Her
              creativity shines in her innovative projects, contributing fresh
              perspectives to the collaborative learning environment. She has a
              keen eye for design, coupled with an innate understanding of
              UI/UX. Every project, whether backend or frontend, took into
              account how it would be used and optimized to make that as usage
              as easy as possible. She also actively supports her peers,
              including working with potential future students in some of the
              course offerings that ran alongside her class. Val&apos;s
              thoughtfulness and intentionality in approaching tasks are
              commendable. Her commitment extends beyond standard class hours,
              showcasing a passion for the craft and a dedication to continuous
              improvement. Val&apos;s unique blend of skills and mindset puts
              her in a great position to go far in this industry, and I&apos;m
              honored to endorse her as a standout talent.

              TA @ Carolina Code School

            <p>
              I had the privilege of working alongside Val during her time at
              our code school. Val demonstrated an analytical mindset and
              adaptability to diverse technologies, showcasing her as both a
              skilled developer and an independent thinker. Her initiative in
              taking on new technology challenges, as seen in her individual
              final project involving Remix and Shopify, speaks to her ability
              to navigate beyond the classroom curriculum. I recommend Val for
              her technical acumen, analytical mindset, and innovative approach
              to challenges in the ever-evolving field of software development.

              Val possesses a great balance of initiative, thoughtfulness, and
              technical skill. Above all, she is proactive and inquisitive -
              naturally wanting to solve problems and make progress. Hopefully
              our professional paths align again very soon and I cannot wait to
              see what great things she does in this world, tech and beyond.
