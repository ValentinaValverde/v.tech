  Hi, I’m Val! I’m an 18-year-old web developer with an eye for UI/UX design. I
  currently work out of a coworking space that gives me the opportunity to talk
  with really interesting and talented people. I attained this job through an
  apprenticeship program, and I am given prompts each week to complete. I also
  like to write about technical challenges I may face, or even just personal
  thoughts in the workplace. If you’d like to know more about my technical side,
  be sure to checkout my technical portfolio! Otherwise, you can checkout my
  Github or connect with me on LinkedIn. Thanks!
